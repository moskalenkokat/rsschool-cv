## About Me 
I am diligent, do monotonous work for a long time. I like to constantly study and learn something new. Difficult tasks do not scare me, but motivate me. I'm also not afraid to ask for help if I don't understand something. I can't start a new task until I finish the previous one. In this regard, the work is carried out in a quality and timely manner.
